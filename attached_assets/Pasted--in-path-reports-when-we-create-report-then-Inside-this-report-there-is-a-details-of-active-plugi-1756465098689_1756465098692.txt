
in path /reports when we  create report then Inside this report there is a details of active plugins but the countings are not available so fix that

my production api's in api/index.ts and
in loclahost api's in server/routes.ts

step 1 when we create report
Request URL
https://www.aiowebcare.com/api/client-reports

Request URL
https://www.aiowebcare.com/api/client-reports/70/generate
Request Method

Status Code
200 OK

step3 this open a report in new tab
equest URL
https://www.aiowebcare.com/api/client-reports/70
Request Method
GET
Status Code
200 OK


In my opinion I think that when we are generating the report at the time we should enter all the data Still if you think you can read the code so you can understand more information about that

j If you analyze after all this step I am getting mostly data but I am not getting the information of active themes active plugins how many of that are active I am not getting that data
And remember that I do not want any kind of a fall back or a fake data I want real data

The below response represents the local host here you can see the active theme name but in the production it is not coming

            "wordpressVersion": "6.8.2"
        },
        "totalAvailable": 0
    },

And also you should need to work on the active plugins numbers so we can get the real numbers In both the local and the production
loclahsot api's logic in server/routes.ts
and production logic in api/index.ts
